Milestone number 1 of the upcoming 5.0.0 release of RDF4J is now available for download.

This first milestone focuses on removing deprecated code with the largest change being the removal of the Iteration interface in favour of using the CloseableIteration interface instead. The CloseableIteration has also been simplified by removing support for specifying checked exceptions using Java generics. 

This milestone build is not yet feature-complete, but we are putting it out to receive early feedback on all the improvements we have put in.
