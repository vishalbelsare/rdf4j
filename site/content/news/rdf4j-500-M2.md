Milestone number 2 of the upcoming 5.0.0 release of RDF4J is now available for download.

Notable changes since the previous milestone build:
 - We have [switched to the new CONFIG vocabulary](https://github.com/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/pull/4699). If you ware interacting with the config files directly then take care to use the new vocabulary and if need be use the [Configuration class](https://github.com/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/blob/develop/core/model/src/main/java/org/eclipse/rdf4j/model/util/Configurations.java) to help with handling use cases where the new and old config vocabularies are mixed.
 - The refactoring and optimizations of the various iterations is nearing completion and there should be very few iterations that are still marked as deprecated.
 - More deprecated code has been removed, if you find that you were depending on deprecated code that is now removed then please let us know.


This milestone build is not yet feature-complete, but we are putting it out to receive early feedback on all the improvements we have put in.
