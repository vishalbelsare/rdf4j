### Security

The following dependencies and/or transitive dependencies have been updated to address security vulnerabilities:
 - Upgraded spring to 5.3.37
 - Upgraded snappy-java to 1.1.10.5
 - Upgraded netty to 4.1.111

These upgrades fix several issues reported in various CVEs (more details can be found in the RDF4J github [issue list](https://github.com/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Asecurity+is%3Aclosed) ).

users are nevertheless recommended to consider upgrading to the latest version of RDF4J.
